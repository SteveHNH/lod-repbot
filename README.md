# Discord Repbot 

This is a simple bot that just tracks arbitrary reputation in a discord community. The points don't do anything, but it's a fun way
to allow community members to shoutout each other for cool acts. It's "Whose line is it anyway?" points for Discord

## Running the bot

You will need a discord token so that the bot can access your server. You can get instructions on that [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)

Once you have the token, drop it in the .env file in the space provided. Then all you have to do is install dependencies and run it

    $> npm install
    $> node index.js

## Acknowledgements

Huge shoutout to the discord.js project for making this so simple. Getting a bot up and running is cake with that module.
